# Notes

## PureConfig

We use [PureConfig](https://pureconfig.github.io) to read configurations from resource files into ADTs.

WARNING - Everything was fine on version 0.9.2, until I upgraded to 0.10.0 where issues occurred.
So currently stuck on version 0.9.2. Think it has something to do with macros.
