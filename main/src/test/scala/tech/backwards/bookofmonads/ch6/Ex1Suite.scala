   * A value of `State s a` should be understood as a computation that produces values of type `a` while modifying an internal state of types.
   * In fact, we can see `State s a` as the encoding of functions from an initial state to their return values, paired with the new state:
   * {{{
   *   type State s a = s -> (a, s)
   * }}}

   * Due to restrictions in the way type class instances in Haskell are resolved, it is not possible to write a Monad instance for a type synonym.
   * So instead it is better to define State as:

   *   newtype State s a = State { runState :: s -> (a, s) }
