DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING

We could inspect or update the internal state directly.
For example, this is a function that updates a counter - represented as an integral state â€” and gives back the current value:
-}
nextValue :: State Int Int
nextValue = State (\i -> (i, i + 1))
{-
This is not a good idea for exactly the same reasons that it is not a good idea to access private methods from a module or class.
Instead, we should use the functions that State provides as an interface to build stateful computations.

The interface for State is comprised of three functions, namely (get, put, modify):
-}
get :: State s s
get = State $ \s -> (s, s)

put :: s -> State s ()
put s = State $ \_ -> ((), s)

modify :: (s -> s) -> State s ()
modify f = do
  s <- get
  put $ f s
