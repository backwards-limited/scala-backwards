A pattern emerges, which will fomulate the "applicative style".

Each time we want to use a pure function in a monadic (or applicative) context, we use:
fmap f x1 `ap` x2 `ap` ... `ap` xN

by introducing symbols we get:
f <$> x1 <*> x2 <*> ... <*> xN

Now instead of the following do block:
do x <- [1,2,3]
   y <- [4,5,6]
   return (x + y)

we can instead, in applicative style:
(+) <$> [1,2,3] <*> [4,5,6]

In the realm of pure computation, it never makes sense to execute code if you do not want its return value, since that is the only visible effect coming out of that call.
For monadic or applicative computations, this is not the case, as you might want to execute one of these actions for its side effects alone, completely disregarding the value returned from the action.
Haskellâ€™s standard library provides three, special combinators for that case:

(<$) :: Functor     f =>   a -> f b -> f a

(<*) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f a

(*>) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f b

YOU CANNOT DO
map toUpper <$> validateName name <*> validateAge age

The problem is that map toUpper takes only one argument.

Solutions are:
map toUpper <$> validateName name <* validateAge age

map toUpper <$ validateAge age <*> validateName name

And if we want to effectively hard code age (much like a constant) we can do:
(\n -> Person n 20) <$> validateName name

or
flip Person 20 <$> validateName name

But it would be easier to lift the pure value of 20:
Person <$> validateName name <*> pure 20
