       - Streaming I/O: Loading incrementally big data sets that would not fit in memory
         and operating on them without blowing your heap.

       - Control Flow: Moving data from one/several DBs/files/APIs to others in a nice declarative way.

       - Concurrency: Run different streams in parallel and make them communicate together.
         For example loading data from multiple files and processing them concurrently as opposed to sequentially.
         You can do some advanced stuff here.
         Streams can communicate together during the processing stage and not only at the end.
